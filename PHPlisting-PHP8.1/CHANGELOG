[BUGFIXES]

001 An error occurred when viewing archived or cancelled listing invoices linked to a deleted pricing plan.

/app/Views/default/misc/invoice.html.php

002 An error would occur when trying to view a listing claim after its associated pricing plan had been removed.

/app/Controllers/Admin/Claims.php
/app/Controllers/Account/Claims.php
/app/Controllers/Admin/Products.php
/app/Controllers/Admin/Pricings.php
/app/Models/Pricing.php

003 Custom upload types can no longer be removed if associated with at least one custom form field. To proceed with removal, either the linked field must be deleted or assigned a different upload type.

/app/Models/UploadType.php
/app/Controllers/Admin/UploadTypes.php
/app/I18n/en/admin.php:
'uploadtypes.alert.remove.failed' => 'Unable to delete upload type ":name" due to linked custom form fields. Update or remove those fields before proceeding.',

004 We now verify that all imported CSV file column values are in the UTF-8 encoding. If any field contains non-UTF-8 characters, the entire listing record is skipped.

/app/Controllers/Cron.php
/app/I18n/en/admin.php:
'import.error.encoding' => 'Line :line: Non-UTF-8 characters in ":field" value. Listing skipped.',

005 Listing search impressions statistics were mistakenly counted twice in the Listingsearchresults widget, resulting in doubled listing search impression raw stats. This did not affect the daily statistics since the compilation process excludes duplicate records from the same IP.

/app/Widgets/Listingsearchresults.php

006 Orders paid through subscription gateway modules, such as Stripe Subscription, are now restricted from cancellation by the listing owner even if the associated pricing plan has the 'Cancellable' option enabled.

/app/Controllers/Account/Listings.php

007 Adjustments were made to the opening hours and file upload form fields to prevent content overflow from the field container on iPhone 12 mini.

/app/Views/default/form/field/hours.html.php

008 The wrong language phrase was used in the breadcrumb on the admin's widget field options management page.

/app/Views/default/admin/widget-field-options/*

009 Phantom image placeholders on file upload forms. Non-public types like category or location logos can no longer be assigned to custom form fields of the 'File' type.

/app/Controllers/Admin/Fields.php
/app/Controllers/Admin/ListingFields.php

010 When a new rating category was added to the existing reviews, a default rating of 2.5 stars was applied, rather than using 0 stars.

/app/Views/default/form/field/rating.html.php
